Studyya is a personal project repository. This repo currently contains an artifact (pomodoro-ai-focus.zip) and placeholder project structure.

Replace this file with a short one-line description of the project's purpose.

## Quick start

1. Clone:
   git clone https://github.com/dexiainstreamer-dot/Studyya.git
   cd Studyya

2. Inspect the repository:
   - There is a zip artifact at `pomodoro-ai-focus.zip`. If this is a built artifact, consider using GitHub Releases instead of committing large zips to the repository root.

3. Build / Run (placeholder)
   - If this is a Java/Maven project:
     mvn test
   - If this is Node:
     npm install && npm test

Replace the commands above with the real build/test steps for this project.
